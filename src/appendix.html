<H2> HFR Estimation using Block-Bootstrap and Cubic Splines. </H2>

<H3> Algorithm Walkthrough: </H3>

<body>
<ul>
    <li> Fit a cubic smoothing spline \(S(t)\) to the 7-day lagged average HFRs, where the HFR for day
         \(t \in \{1, ..., T\}\) is denoted \(HFR_t\).
        This provides an estimate of the trend. 
        Now we would like confidence intervals around this trend.
        </Li>
        <li> ``Pre-whiten" the data by taking the residuals of the cubic spline \(r_t = \{S(t) - HFR_t\}\), where \(t \in \{1, 2, ..., T\}\). 
        </Li>
        <li> Among the series of residuals \(\{r_1, r_2, ..., r_T\}\), 
        use a moving block-bootstrap (MBB) 
        with block size \(B = 7\) days in order 
        to resample \(N = 1000\) replicates of length \(T\). 
        The MBB splits the series into \(T - B + 1\) 
        overlapping blocks of length \(B\), 
        and draws \(T/B\) blocks at random with replacement. 
        Concatenating these blocks in the order they are drawn 
        yields a new series of residuals 
        \(r'^{(i)} = \{r'^{(i)}_1, r'^{(i)}_2, ..., r'^{(i)}_T\}\),
        where \(i \in \{1, 2, ..., N\}\)
        (since this step is repeated \(N\) times to create \(N\) replicates).
        </Li>
        <li> ``Post-blacken" each of the residual replicates 
        by adding it back onto the estimated trend \(S(t)\) in step 1. 
        This gives us new HFR trajectories 
        \(HFR'^{(i)} = \{S(1) + r'^{(i)}_1, S(2) + r'^{(i)}_2, ..., S(T) + r'^{(i)}_T\}\),
        where \(i \in \{1, 2, ..., N\}\), 
        drawn from the original data distribution 
        (assuming exchangeable blocks of residuals). 
        </Li>
        <li> Re-estimate the trend for each of the trajectories 
        \(HFR'^{(i)}\) using a cubic smoothing spline 
        \(S'^{(i)}(t)\), \(i \in \{1, 2, ..., N\}\). 
        Equipped with these fitted splines 
        \(\{S'^{(1)}(t), S'^{(2)}(t), ..., S'^{(N)}(t)\}\) 
        from block-bootstrapping the residuals and post-blackening, 
        we can now estimate the trend and \(95\%\) confidence intervals 
        for any time \(t \in \{1, 2, ..., T\}\).
        </Li>
</ul>

<H3> Estimate of trend and uncertainty in age-stratified HFRs: </H3>

While we focus on the two peaks and 
the endpoints of the study time range,
we can easily read off similar estimates 
with uncertainty for all dates between 
April 1st and December 1st (Fig.1).
Overall, the cubic smoothing splines 
appear to fit the 7-day lagged average HFRs relatively well. 
Consistent with our point estimates, 
the overall HFR in Florida appears relatively flat 
until August, in which the HFR decreases 
greatly across all age groups 
(Fig.1a). 
In the national data, there appears to be 
an almost monotonic decline in HFR 
across all age groups for the entire time range,
with the decrease slowing down in August, 
but slightly picking up again in December
(Fig.1b).

<H2> State-wise distribution </H2>

Between April 1st and April 15th, \(34.5\%\) of national CDC cases were recorded in New York alone.
Over the next three monthes, cases in New York had diminished and were starting to surge in other states.
